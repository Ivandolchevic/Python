# Python

This repository is a public collection of Reference Materials produced by David Coxon while learning Pyton in 2017. It consists mainly of Jupyter notebooks.

The repository is intended as a working repository which will be regularly updated and which can refer back to when reviewing learning or shared with other python students looking for resources or referebce points.

The key documents in this repository are :

Libraries.ipynb - a list of useful libraries divided into areas of use.

Data_Sources.ipynb - a list of useful datasets

Useful Resources.ipynb - a list of links to recommended reading and useful online tools.

Data Camp Python Modules.ipynb - a list of Data Camp Courses and their content.

I have 2 further Python Repositories on Github which remain private either because they caontain real data of a confidential nature relating to organisations that I am working with or because they are specific notes or code based very closely on content from Data Camp which is a subscription service and i don't have permission to share publically.
