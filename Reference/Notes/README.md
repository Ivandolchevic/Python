# Python

This repository is a public collection of Notes produced by David Coxon while learning Pyton in 2017. It consists mainly of Jupyter notebooks for python and contains any associated datasets required to run the code along with any images/graphs that were produced that have been use elsewhere. 

The repository is intended as a working repository which I can refer back to when reviewing my learning, it is also intended as a resource that can be shared with other students learning python. 

I have 2 further Python Repositories on Github which remain private either because they caontain real data of a confidential nature relating to organisations that I am working with or because they are specific notes or code based very closely on content from Data Camp which is a subscription service and i don't have permission to share publically.
