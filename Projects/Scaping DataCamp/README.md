# Scraping DataCamp

## a Python Project

DataCamp offers interactive R and Python courses on topics in data science, statistics, and machine learning. Learn from a team of expert teachers in the comfort of your browser with video lessons and fun coding challenges.

Each of the DataCamp courses consists of both videos and practice exercises. Both the tutorials and exercises use sample data. Generally the sample data is from opendata sets, available to download from the internet. 

For convenience DataCamp generally include the CSV files on the course home page, but this loads the data into the browser and you have to download each CSV file separately. 

This project uses the magic of Beautiful Soup, Regex, and Pandas to automate that process finding the cvs files and downloading them to a local Directory.
 
I have included a python script and a Jupyter notebook within the repository. All of the knowledge required to build this project came from the DataCamp Courses: Importing Data with Python (part 2) & DataScience ToolBox for Python (part 2)
