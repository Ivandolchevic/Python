# Drawing Pythons and Turtles

## a Python Project
 
I came across the Turtles Library whist watching a Udacity tutorial on python. You can find this free Udacity course at https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036.

Turtles is a really simple library often used to teaching coding principles. You move a turtle around the canvas using directions forward(), Backward(), left() and right(). You can also tell the turtle when to simply move and to draw while it moves.

The simpleness of the functions means that someone new to coding could pickup it effectively and very quickly advance to writing python code that makes use of maths and looping to construct more complex patterns.
 
![Repeating Pattern](Graphs/rainbowrepeatingshape.jpg?raw=true)

The Notebook starts with creating a simple shapes like squares and builds up to creating repeating geometrical patterns using nested loops and random numbers.

The project was intended to be used by groups like Coderdojo to teach coding structures like while loops, but it could also be used to explore maths, geometry or even art.
