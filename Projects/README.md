# Python Projects
## a small repository of learning experiments created by David Coxon

Hi, I’m David Coxon, I am Head of IT at ![BALTIC](http://baltic.art) Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead. Part of my role at BALTIC involves data analysis and over the last 15 years I have developed a keen interest in what is now referred to as Data Science.

My journey into Python began in 2016. I already had some experience in coding and using R for Data Science, but when I started the ![Becoming a Datascientist Learning Club](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/) programme, chose to learning Python to do it.

For me when it comes to learning a new language and properly understanding how the code works, there is no substitute for diving in an writing code myself. 

Rather than just writing snippets of code to create a function that square a value, iterates through random numbers or returns a pearson’s value, I have produced a number of small projects to put the code into a more practical context.

While my primary reason for studying Python is to develop my  knowledge of Data Science, the beauty of the Python language is that the fundamental building blocks can be used for a wide variety of tasks. The projects in this Repository therefore are not simply limited to those tasks you might associate with Data Science and Machine learning, but include other things as well. 

Many of the projects I have undertaken relating to Data Science are based on real data and solving actual problem in the office, Unfortunately these can’t be shared and are in a private repro.

The majority of projects have some sort of practical application.
