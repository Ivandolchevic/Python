## about David Coxon

Hi, I’m David Coxon, I am Head of IT at [BALTIC](http://baltic.art) Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead. Part of my role at BALTIC involves data analysis and over the last 15 years I have developed a keen interest in what is now referred to as Data Science. 

My journey into Python began in 2016. I already had some experience in coding and using R for Data Science, but when I started the [Becoming a Datascientist Learning Club](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/) programme, chose to learning Python to do it.

For me when it comes to learning a new language and properly understanding how the code works, there is no substitute for diving in an writing code myself. 

Rather than just writing snippets of code to create a function that square a value, iterates through random numbers or returns a pearson’s value, I have produced a number of small projects to put the code into a more practical context.

## about the projects

While my primary reason for studying Python is to develop my  knowledge of Data Science, the beauty of the Python language is that the fundamental building blocks can be used for a wide variety of tasks. The projects in this Repository therefore are not simply limited to those tasks you might associate with Data Science and Machine learning, but include other things as well. 

The majority of projects in this repository have some sort of practical application whether its scraping data, wrangling text or teaching coding.

Many of the more Data Science related projects I have undertaken are based on using sensitive data to solve business problems for Galleries unfortunately these can’t be shared and are in a private repro.

## coming next

![DATACAMP](Images/datacamp.png?raw=true)

While 2017 was all about completing the Data Analysis Track on [DATACAMP](https://www.datacamp.com.com/). In 2018 I hope to complete the remaining units on Machine learning to complete the Data Science track.

![UDACITY](Images/udacity.png?raw=true)

Later this I am hoping build on by Data Science foundation by securing a scholarship for a nano degree at [UDACITY](https://eu.udacity.com/nanodegree). This would provide plenty of opportunities to add my projects Portfolio.

2018 is also the year for getting more involved in the local Python community. The is [North East Python Group](https://www.pythonnortheast.com/) that meet monthly and a new [North East Data Science Group](https://www.meetup.com/Newcastle-Upon-Tyne-Data-Science-Meetup/) that I would love to get involved with.
