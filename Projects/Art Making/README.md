# Art Making
## a Python Project with Ktinter

You may well be wondering why there is an art project amongst a collection of mainly Data Analytics and Machine Learning projects in my Repository, but in my current role as Head of IT at BALTIC Centre of Contemporary Art I support out learning programme as well as analysing our Business Data.

Ktinter is the de facto standard of Graphic User Interface (GUI) for python. When I started learning python I found the classic online tutorials for noughts and crosses (tic tac toe) and Hangman. Ktinter was being used to draw the graphic for both games.

The tic tac toe code draws 2 sets of parallel lines forming the grid for the game. It occurred to me that with a few tweaks the same code could be used with a random number generator to form more abstract patterns… I began wondering how abstract patterns would have to be to become Art!

While I never got around to building the noughts and crosses game. I did continue to play with the idea of using Ktinder to produce a variety of patterns. The idea being that the project could be used to teach kids to code and to think about the process of making Art.
