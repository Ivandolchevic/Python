# Fun with Pythons and Turtles

I came across the Turtles Library while watching a tutorial from Udacity on learning python. It was part a free course from Udacity that you can find at https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036. Its a slow paced beginner level course, but thaught in a way that is really easy to follow. 

Essentially Turtles is a really simple library that is generally used to teaching coding principles, you can move a turtle around the canvas using forward(), Backward(), left() and right() commands. You can also tell it when to draw and when to just move.

while in some ways its a super simple function that a small child could use, effectively you can also use functions and loops and a bit of maths to build some quite complex patterns.
 
This project basically builds up step by step from drawing a simple square to creating more complex geometrical patterns.

In part this project can be used to learn or teach elements of coding like creating functions or using while loops, but equally it could be used to explore maths, geometry or even art.
