# Making Art (well Patterns anyway) with Ktinter in Python

When I started to learn python I came across the Ktinter module being used to create a noughts and crosses (tic tac toe) game. 

The code in the Noughts and Crosses game Ktinder being used to draw parrellel lines formming the noughts and crosses board, this code was really simple and it occured to be that the same code could be used really easily with basic random numbers to form patterns. 

While i never got around to building the noughts and crosses game, I had played with the idea of using Ktinder to produce a variety of different pattern, the idea being that this could then be used to teach kits about for loops, random numbers and simple maths as part of a coding glass in the gallery I work in.
