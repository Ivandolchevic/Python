# Who’s Turn

This really simple Project was my attempt at creating something in python. All it does is use a random number generator to come up with a number then use an if loop to decide who’s turn it was to make the drinks. 

I wrote the code while on holiday in the Lake district with family, and my 9 year old nephew and niece Hannah and Thomas helped come up with the idea.
