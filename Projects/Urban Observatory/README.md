The Urban Observatory is the largest set of publicly available real time urban data in the UK. Sensors are gathering data across the city in Newcastle upon Tyne.

The project from Newcastle University has over 50 data types and counting and millions of individual data points over a growing time duration. 

## about the project

I met Phil James one of the people behind the project in October 2017 and got early access to the api. As a major North East visitor attraction I was interested in seeing if there was a relationship between the weather data and BALTICâ€™s visitor numbers. 

In fact climate data could be extremely relevant to a number of interesting projects and as keen runner and cyclist (I ride or run to work most days) air quality is also very interesting to me. 

At the moment this project is little more that a place holder for a future project that will use this awesome resource.
